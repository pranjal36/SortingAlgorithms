## How to contribute?

#### **Did you find a bug?**

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under the issues section.

- Please avoid opening issues asking to be "assigned” to a particular algorithm. This merely creates unnecessary noise for maintainers. Instead, please submit your implementation in a pull request and it will be evaluated by project maintainers.

- If you are unable to find an open issue referring to the same problem, depending on the type of issue follow the appropriate steps:

#### **Do you want to contribute to the documentation?**

- Please read the documentation in here [Contributing to the Documentation](https://github.com/Isha2103/SortingAlgorithms/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) ,[open a new one issue](https://github.com/Isha2103/SortingAlgorithms/issues/new), make changes and then create a pull request, it will be put under review and accepted if it is appropriate.

#### **Do you want to add a new feature?**

- [Open a new one issue](https://github.com/Isha2103/SortingAlgorithms/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and a clear description** and a **test case** demonstrating the new feature that you want to add to the project.
